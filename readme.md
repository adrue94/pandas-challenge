This assignment was long and a little difficult. Using Pandas and DataFrames took some practice, but it feels much more powerful than pure python. I had a lot of trouble manipulating the columns and making sure the data aligns properly, I ended up having to merge DFs just to wrangle them in place. Not elegant, but works. 

No code sourced from anywhere, just a lot of googling then reading documentation and stackoverflow for help.
